### Core Functionality
- âœ… Created a full notes management system
- âœ… Implemented note creation with sentiment analysis
- âœ… Built tag management system for organization
- âœ… Set up filtering by tags, sentiment, and search terms
- âœ… Added note editing and deletion capabilities

### Key UI Components
- âœ… Main `/notes` page with two-column layout (content + sticky notes)
- âœ… Individual note view/edit page
- âœ… New note creation page
- âœ… Settings page with appearance and data management options

### Technical Components

- âœ… Implemented responsive UI with Tailwind and shadcn/ui

## Next Steps

### Backend Integration
- ðŸ”² Replace mock notes provider with Supabase client
- ðŸ”² Connect API routes to Supabase database
- ðŸ”² Implement authentication and user management
- ðŸ”² Add proper error handling and loading states

### Enhanced Features
- ðŸ”² Implement file import (PDF, text) functionality
- ðŸ”² Add advanced filtering options (date ranges, reference sources)
- ðŸ”² Create a dashboard view with note statistics
- ðŸ”² Add keyboard shortcuts and improved UX

### Deployment
- ðŸ”² Set up CI/CD pipeline
- ðŸ”² Configure proper environment variables
- ðŸ”² Deploy to Vercel or similar platform

## Getting Started

To run the application:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh`
3. Follow the instructions to set up Supabase tables
4. The application will start on http://localhost:3000

## Implementation Details

The application follows these key design principles:
- **Clean UI**: Minimalistic design with focus on content and organization
- **Visual Organization**: Color-coded notes based on sentiment for quick identification
- **Efficient Workflow**: Two-column layout with clear separation of concerns
- **Extensible**: Built with a modular approach to easily add new features

The data model is designed to support:
- Notes with content, sentiment analysis, and timestamps
- Tags for organization
- References to external sources (in future iterations)

## Known Issues
- Currently using in-memory storage; will lose data on refresh until Supabase is fully integrated
- Some TypeScript linting errors need to be addressed
- Mobile responsiveness could be improved
